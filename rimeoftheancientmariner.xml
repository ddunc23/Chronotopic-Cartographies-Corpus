How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by <strong>Storms</strong> to the cold
Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course
to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange
things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to
his own Country.</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE FIRST.">
<chrono value="present" />
<space ="ext" />
<p>It is an ancyent Marinere,
And he stoppeth one of three.
"By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye
Now wherefore stoppest me?</p>

<p>"The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set,
May'st hear the merry din."</p>

<p>But still he holds the wedding-guest,
There was a Ship, quoth he.
"Nay, if thou'st got a laughsome tale,
"Marinere! come with me."</p>

<p>He holds him with his skinny hand,
Quoth he, there was a Ship.
"Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon!"
"Or my Staff shall make thee skip."</p>

<p>He holds him with his glittering eye--
The Wedding-Guest stood still,
And listens like a three year's child:
The Marinere hath his will.</p>

<p>The Wedding-Guest sate on a stone:
He cannot chuse but hear;
And thus spake on that ancyent  man,
The bright-eyed Marinere.</p>

<litpers value="first" />
<grounds value="uncertain" />
<chrono value="past-diet" />
<p><claye><lstate="generic" lscape="path" />The Ship was cheer'd, the Harbour clear'd,
Merrily did we drop
Below the Kirk, below the Hill,
Below the Light-house top.</claye></p>

<p>The Sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he!
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea.</p>

<p>Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon--
<chrono value="present" /><litpers value="omni" /><grounds value="objective" />The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.</p>

<p>The bride hath pac'd into the Hall,
Red as a rose is she;
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry Minstralsy.</p>

<p>The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot chuse but hear;
And thus spake on that ancyent man,
The bright-eyed Marinere.</p>
<chrono value="past-dist" />
<litpers value="first" />
<grounds value="uncertain" />

<p>Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind,
 A Wind and Tempest strong!
For days and weeks it play'd us freaks--
 Like Chaff we drove along.</p>

<p>Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,
And it grew wond'rous cold:
<claye><lstate="generic" lscape="feature-natural" />And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as Emerauld.</p>

<p><claye><lstate="generic" lscape="scape-wild" />And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:
Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken--
The Ice was all between.</p>

<p>The Ice was here, the Ice was there,
The Ice was all around:
It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd,
Like <claye-sense value="audio">noises</claye-sense> of a swound!</claye></p>

<p>At length did cross an Albatross:
Thorough the fog it came;
And an it were a Christian Soul,
We hail'd it in God's name.</p>

<p>The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,
And round and round it flew.
<claye><lstate="generic" lscape="scape-wild" />The ice did split with a Thunder-fit;
<lstate="generic" lscape="path" />The helmsman steer'd us thro'.</claye></p>

<p>And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow;
And every day for food or play
Came to the Marinere's hollo!</p>

<p>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perch'd for vespers nine;
Whiles all the night thro' fog-smoke white,
Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.</p>

<p>"God save thee, ancient Marinere!
From the fiends, that plague thee thus--
"Why look'st thou so?"--With my cross bow
I shot the Albatross.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE SECOND.">

<p>The Sun came up upon the right,
Out of the Sea came he;
And broad as a weft upon the left
Went down into the sea.</p>

<p>And the good south wind still blew behind
But no sweet Bird did follow,
Ne any day for food or play
Came to the Marinere's hollo!</p>

<p>And I had done an hellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all averr'd, I had kill'd the bird
That made the Breeze to blow.</p>

<p>Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,
The glorious Sun uprist:
Then all averr'd, I had kill'd the bird
That brought the fog and mist.
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,
That bring the fog and mist.</p>

<p><claye><lstate="generic" lscape="path" />The breezes blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow follow'd free:</claye>
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent Sea.</p>

<p>Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,
'Twas sad as sad could be;
And we did speak only to break
The silence of the Sea.</p>

<p>All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.</p>

<p>Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, ne breath ne motion;
As idle as a painted Ship
Upon a painted Ocean.</p>

<p>Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Ne any drop to drink.</p>

<p>The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy Sea.</p>

<p>About, about, in reel and rout
The death-fires danc'd at night;
<claye><lstate="generic" lscape="los-region" />The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green and blue and white.</claye></p>

<p>And some in dreams assured were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so:
Nine fathom deep he had follow'd us
From the Land of Mist and Snow.</p>

<p>And every tongue thro' utter drouth
Was wither'd at the root;
We could not speak, no more than if
We had been choked with soot.</p>

<p>Ah well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young;
Instead of the Cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE THIRD.">

<p>There passed a weary time.  Each throat
Was parched, and glazed each eye.
A weary time! a weary time!
How glazed each weary eye,
When looking westward, I beheld
A something in the sky.</p>

<p>At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist:
It moved and moved, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.</p>

<p>A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.</p>

<p>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could not laugh nor wail;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!</p>

<p>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in,
As they were drinking all.</p>

<p>See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel!</p>

<p>The western wave was all a-flame
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave
Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the Sun.</p>

<p>And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,
With broad and burning face.</p>

<p>Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres!</p>

<p>Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through a grate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a DEATH? and are there two?
Is DEATH that woman's mate?</p>

<p>Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.</p>

<p>The naked hulk alongside came,
And the twain were casting dice;
"The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!"
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.</p>

<p>The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
At one stride comes the dark;
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.
Off shot the spectre-bark.</p>

<p>We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,
My life-blood seemed to sip!</p>

<p>The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
From the sails the dew did drip--
Till clombe above the eastern bar
The horned Moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip.</p>

<p>One after one, by the star-dogged Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh,
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
And cursed me with his eye.</p>

<p>Four times fifty living men,
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one.</p>

<p>The souls did from their bodies fly,--
They fled to bliss or woe!
And every soul, it passed me by,
Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE FOURTH.">

<p>"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!
I fear thy skinny hand!
And thou art long, and lank, and brown,
As is the ribbed sea-sand.</p>

<p>"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,
And thy skinny hand, so brown."--
Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!
This body dropt not down.</p>

<p>Alone, alone, all, all alone,
Alone on a wide wide sea!
And never a saint took pity on
My soul in agony.</p>

<p>The many men, so beautiful!
And they all dead did lie:
And a thousand thousand slimy things
Lived on; and so did I.</p>

<p>I looked upon the rotting sea,
And drew my eyes away;
I looked upon the rotting deck,
And there the dead men lay.</p>

<p>I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:
But or ever a prayer had gusht,
A wicked whisper came, and made
my heart as dry as dust.</p>

<p>I closed my lids, and kept them close,
And the balls like pulses beat;
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
Lay like a load on my weary eye,
And the dead were at my feet.</p>

<p>The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
Nor rot nor reek did they:
The look with which they looked on me
Had never passed away.</p>

<p>An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
A spirit from on high;
But oh! more horrible than that
Is a curse in a dead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,
And yet I could not die.</p>

<p>The moving Moon went up the sky,
And no where did abide:
Softly she was going up,
And a star or two beside.</p>

<p>Her beams bemocked the sultry main,
Like April hoar-frost spread;
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway
A still and awful red.</p>

<p>Beyond the shadow of the ship,
I watched the water-snakes:
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared, the elfish light
Fell off in hoary flakes.</p>

<p>Within the shadow of the ship
I watched their rich attire:
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,
They coiled and swam; and every track
Was a flash of golden fire.</p>

<p>O happy living things! no tongue
Their beauty might declare:
A spring of love gushed from my heart,
And I blessed them unaware:
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
And I blessed them unaware.</p>

<p>The self same moment I could pray;
And from my neck so free
The Albatross fell off, and sank
Like lead into the sea.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE FIFTH.">

<p>O sleep, it is a gentle thing,
Belov'd from pole to pole!
To Mary-queen the praise be yeven
She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,
That slid into my soul.</p>

<p>The silly buckets on the deck,
That had so long remain'd,
I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew;
And when I awoke it rain'd.</p>

<p>My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
My garments all were dank;
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
And still my body drank.</p>

<p>I mov'd and could not feel my limbs,
I was so light--almost
I thought that I had died in sleep,
And was a blessed Ghost.</p>

<p>The roaring wind! it roar'd far off
It did not come anear;
But with its sound it shook the sails,
That were so thin and sere.</p>

<p>The upper air burst into life,
And a hundred fire-flags sheen,
To and fro they were hurried about!
And to and fro, and in and out,
The stars dance on between.</p>

<p>The coming wind doth roar more loud,
And the sails did sigh, like sedge:
The rain poured down from one black cloud
And the Moon is at its edge.</p>

<p>Hark! hark! the thick black cloud is cleft,
And the Moon is at its side:
Like waters shot from some high crag,
The lightning falls with never a jag,
A river steep and wide.</p>

<p>The strong wind never reach'd the ship: it roar'd
And dropp'd down, like a stone!
Beneath the lightning and the Moon
The dead men gave a groan.</p>

<p>They groan'd, they stirr'd, they all uprose,
Ne spake, ne mov'd their eyes;
It had been strange, even in a dream,
To have seen those dead men rise.</p>

<p>The helmsman steered, the ship mov'd on;
Yet never a breeze up blew;
The Marineres all 'gan work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do:</p>

<p>They rais'd their limbs like lifeless tools--
We were a ghastly crew.</p>

<p>The body of my brother's son,
Stood by me, knee to knee:
The body and I pulled at one rope,
But he said nought to me. 
And I quak'd to think of my own voice
How frightful it would be!</p>

<p>The day-light dawn'd--they dropp'd their arms,
And cluster'd round the mast;
Sweet sounds rose slowly thro' their mouths
And from their bodies pass'd.</p>

<p>Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the sun;
Slowly the sounds came back again,
Now mix'd, now one by one.</p>

<p>Sometimes a dropping from the sky
I heard the Lavrock sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are,
How they seem'd to fill the sea and air
With their sweet jargoning,</p>

<p>And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;
And now it is an angel's song,
That makes the heavens be mute.</p>

<p>It ceas'd; yet still the sails made on
A pleasant noise till noon,
<claye><lstate="generic" lscape="scape-projection" />A <claye-sense value="audio">noise</claye-sense> like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune.</claye></p>

<p>Listen, O listen, thou Wedding-guest!
"Marinere! thou hast thy will:
"For that, which comes out of thine eye, doth make
"My body and soul to be still."</p>

<p>Never sadder tale was told
 To a man of woman born:
 Sadder and wiser thou wedding-guest!
 Thou'lt rise to morrow morn.</p>

<p>Never sadder tale was heard
 By a man of woman born:
 The Marineres all return'd to work
 As silent as beforne.</p>

<p>The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,
 But look at me they n'old:
 Thought I, I am as thin as air--
 They cannot me behold.</p>

<p>Till noon we silently sail'd on,
Yet never a breeze did breathe:
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,
Mov'd onward from beneath.</p>

<p>Under the keel nine fathom deep,
From the land of mist and snow,
The spirit slid: and it was he
That made the Ship to go.
The sails at noon left off their tune,
And the ship stood still also.</p>

<p>The Sun, right up above the mast,
Had fix'd her to the ocean:
But in a minute she 'gan stir,
With a short uneasy motion--
Backwards and forwards half her length
With a short uneasy motion.</p>

<p>Then, like a pawing horse let go,
She made a sudden bound:
It flung the blood into my head,
And I fell down in a swound.</p>

<p>How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life return'd,
I heard and in my soul discern'd
Two voices in the air,</p>

<p>"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
By him who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he lay'd full low,
The harmless Albatross.</p>

<p>"The spirit who 'bideth by himself
In the land of mist and snow,
He lov'd the bird that loved the man
Who shot him with his bow."</p>

<p>The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:
Quoth he, "The man hath penance done,
And penance more will do."</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE SIXTH.">
FIRST VOICE.

<p>"But tell me, tell me! speak again,
"Thy soft response renewing--
"What makes that ship drive on so fast?
"What is the Ocean doing?"</p>


SECOND VOICE.

<p>"Still as a slave before his lord,
"The Ocean hath no blast:
"His great bright eye most silently
"Up to the Moon is cast--</p>

<p>"If he may know which way to go;
"For she guides him smooth or grim.
"See, brother, see! how graciously
"She looketh down on him."</p>


FIRST VOICE.

<p>"But why drives on that ship so fast,
"Withouten wave or wind?"</p>


SECOND VOICE.

<p>"The air is cut away before,
"And closes from behind."</p>

<p>"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high
"Or we shall be belated:
"For slow and slow that ship will go,
"When the Marineres trance is abated."</p>

<p>I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;
The dead men stood together.</p>

<p>All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fix'd on me their stony eyes,
That in the moon did glitter.</p>

<p>The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never pass'd away:
I could not draw my een from theirs,
Ne turn them up to pray.</p>

<p>And in its time the spell was snapt,
And I could move my een:
I look'd far-forth, but little saw
Of what had else been seen.</p>

<p>Like one that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turn'd round, walks on
And turns no more his head:
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.</p>

<p>But soon there breath'd a wind on me,
Ne sound ne motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea
In ripple or in shade.</p>

<p>It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring--
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.</p>

<p>Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sail'd softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--
On me alone it blew.</p>

<p><claye><lstate="generic" lscape="los-vista" /><claye-sense value="emot">O dream of joy!</claye-sense> is this indeed
The light-house top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
Is this mine own countree?</p>

<p>We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray--</claye>
O let me be awake, my God!
Or let me sleep alway.</p>

<p><claye><lstate="generic" lscape="feature-natural" />The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moon light lay,
And the shadow of the moon.</claye></p>

<p>The moonlight bay was white all o'er,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
Like as of torches came.</p>

<p>A little distance from the prow
Those dark-red shadows were;
But soon I saw that my own flesh
Was red as in a glare.</p>

<p>Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat;
And by the Holy rood
A man all light, a seraph-man,
On every corse there stood.</p>

<p>This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand:
It was a heavenly sight:
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light:</p>

<p>This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand,
No voice did they impart--
No voice; but O! the silence sank,
Like music on my heart.</p>

<p>Eftsones I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the pilot's cheer:
My head was turn'd perforce away
And I saw a boat appear.</p>

<p>Then vanish'd all the lovely lights;
The bodies rose anew:
With silent pace, each to his place,
Came back the ghastly crew.
The wind, that shade nor motion made,
On me alone it blew.</p>

<p>The pilot, and the pilot's boy
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy,
The dead men could not blast.</p>

<p>I saw a third--I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="PART THE SEVENTH.">

<p>This Hermit good lives <lstate="generic" lscape="scape-wild" />in that wood
Which slopes down to the sea.</claye>
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
He loves to talk with Marineres
That come from a far Contree.</p>

<p>He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
<lstate="generic" lscape="feature-personal" />He hath a cushion plump:
It is the moss that wholly hides
The rotted old oak-stump.</claye></p>

<p>The Skiff-boat ne'rd: I heard them talk,
"Why, this is strange, I trow!
"Where are those lights so many and fair,
"That signal made but now?</p>

<p>"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said--
"And they answer'd not our cheer!
"The planks looked warp'd, and see those sails
"How thin they are and sere!
"I never saw aught like to them,
"Unless perchance it were</p>

<p><lstate="generic" lscape="scape-wild" />"The skeletons of leaves that lag
My forest brook along;
When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,</claye>
And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below,
That eats the she-wolf's young."</p>

<p>"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look"--
(The Pilot made reply)
"I am a-fear'd"--"Push on, push on!"
Said the Hermit cheerily.</p>

<p>The Boat came closer to the Ship,
But I ne spake ne stirr'd!
The Boat came close beneath the ship,
And strait a sound was heard!</p>

<p>Under the water it rumbled on,
Still louder and more dread:
It reach'd the ship, it split the bay;
The ship went down like lead.</p>

<p>Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,
Which sky and ocean smote:
Like one that hath been seven days drown'd
My body lay afloat;
But, swift as dreams, myself I found
Within the Pilot's boat.</p>

<p>Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,
The boat spun round and round;
And all was still, save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.</p>

<p>I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd
And fell down in a fit.
The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes
And pray'd where he did sit.</p>

<p>I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
Who now doth crazy go,
Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while
His eyes went to and fro.
"Ha! ha!" quoth he--"full plain I see,
The Devil knows how to row."</p>

<p>And now, all in my own Countree,
I stood on the firm land!
The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,
And scarcely he could stand.</p>

<p>"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!"
The Hermit cross'd his brow--
"Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say--
What manner man art thou?"</p>

<chrono value="present" />

<p>Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
With a woeful agony,
Which forc'd me to begin my tale
And then it left me free.</p>

<p>Since then, at an uncertain hour,
Now oftimes and now fewer,
That anguish comes and makes me tell
My ghastly aventure.</p>

<p>I pass, like night, from land to land;
I have strange power of speech;
That moment that his face I see,
I know the man that must hear me;
To him my tale I teach.</p>

<grounds value="reliable" />
<p>What loud uproar bursts from that door!
The wedding-guests are there;
But in the Garden-bower the Bride
And Bride-maids singing are:
And hark the little Vesper-bell,
Which biddeth me to prayer.</p>

<p>O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been
Alone on a wide wide sea:
So lonely 'twas, that God himself
Scarce seemed there to be.</p>

<p>O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,
'Tis sweeter far to me,
To walk together to the Kirk
With a goodly company!--</p>

<p>To walk together to the Kirk,
And all together pray,
While each to his great father bends,
Old men, and babes, and loving friends,
And Youths and Maidens gay!</p>

<p>Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou wedding-Guest!
He prayeth well, who loveth well
Both man and bird and beast.</p>

<p>He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small;
For the dear God who loveth us
He made and loveth all.</p>

<charshift />
<litpers value="omni" />

<p>The Marinere, whose eye is bright,
Whose beard with age is hoar,
Is gone; and now the wedding-guest
Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.</p>

<p>He went like one that hath been stunn'd,
And is of sense forlorn:
A sadder and a wiser man,
He rose the morrow morn.</p>
