How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by Storms to the cold
Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course
to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange
things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to
his own Country.</chapter>

<p>It is an ancyent Marinere,
And he stoppeth one of three.
"By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye
Now wherefore stoppest me?</p>

<p>"The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set,
May'st hear the merry din."</p>

<p>But still he holds the wedding-guest,
There was a Ship, quoth he.
"Nay, if thou'st got a laughsome tale,
"Marinere! come with me."</p>

<p>He holds him with his skinny hand,
Quoth he, there was a Ship.
"Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon!"
"Or my Staff shall make thee skip."</p>

<p>He holds him with his glittering eye--
The Wedding-Guest stood still,
And listens like a three year's child:
The Marinere hath his will.</p>

<p>The Wedding-Guest sate on a stone:
He cannot chuse but hear;
And thus spake on that ancyent  man,
The bright-eyed Marinere.</p>
<p>The Ship was cheer'd, the Harbour clear'd,
Merrily did we drop
Below the Kirk, below the Hill,
Below the Light-house top.</p>

<p>The Sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he!
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea.</p>

<p>Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon--
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.</p>

<p>The bride hath pac'd into the Hall,
Red as a rose is she;
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry Minstralsy.</p>

<p>The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot chuse but hear;
And thus spake on that ancyent man,
The bright-eyed Marinere.</p>

<p>Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind,
 A Wind and Tempest strong!
For days and weeks it play'd us freaks--
 Like Chaff we drove along.</p>

<p>Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,
And it grew wond'rous cold:
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as Emerauld.</p>

<p>And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:
Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken--
The Ice was all between.</p>

<p>The Ice was here, the Ice was there,
The Ice was all around:
It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd,
Like noises of a swound!</p>

<p>At length did cross an Albatross:
Thorough the fog it came;
And an it were a Christian Soul,
We hail'd it in God's name.</p>

<p>The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,
And round and round it flew.
The ice did split with a Thunder-fit;
The helmsman steer'd us thro'.</p>

<p>And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow;
And every day for food or play
Came to the Marinere's hollo!</p>

<p>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perch'd for vespers nine;
Whiles all the night thro' fog-smoke white,
Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.</p>

<p>"God save thee, ancient Marinere!
From the fiends, that plague thee thus--
"Why look'st thou so?"--With my cross bow
I shot the Albatross.</p>
